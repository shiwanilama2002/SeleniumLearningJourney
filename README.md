# Selenium Learning Journey ðŸš€

## ðŸ“… Day 1: Browser Automation
- Open Google in Chrome & Edge using Selenium.
- Print page titles.

## ðŸ“… Day 2: Locators (Finding Elements)
- Used ID, Name, Class, XPath.
- Searched for "Selenium (software)" on Wikipedia.
- Printed the search result heading.

  ðŸ“… Day 3: On this day, I added Selenium test cases for the Google homepage validation. The test cases include:

Verify Browser Launch: Ensures the Chrome browser opens successfully.
Search Google: Verifies that the Google homepage loads properly.
Validate Page Title: Confirms that the title of the Google homepage is "Google".
